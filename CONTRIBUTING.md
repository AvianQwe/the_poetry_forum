# Submitting Contributions

The following steps below outline how to make contributions to the existing project.

## Step 0 : Fork the Project/Repository

- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository for you to work on.  This will make a copy on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.

## Step 1 : Go through README file

- Go through the detailed guidelines and screenshots. 
- Scroll to the bottom where there are poems, you will find your poem there after successful PR.

## Step 2: Edit the readme.md file

- Edit the readme.md file and add your poem at the very end.

## Step 3 : Commit changes
-After writing lines have to commit the file to the forked repo. For this click **commit changes** .
-After commiting changes in the forked repo, you should click on **create a pull request** to create PR to original repo. 

## Step 4: Create a pull Request

- Next step would be to create a pull request and then adding a title and description to the changes you've made to the project.

- A good description is always better to properly convey what you did.

And, you're done. Your pull request would be submitted and reviewed and merged.

- You can compare the changes you've made in your branch with those in the main project. Just click on the compare button.

## In case you got stuck.
- It might seem like a lot if it's your first time but everyone started out new to GitHub and open source at some point. If you missed a few steps, don't worry, try again. You'll definitely get better.


All the Best! 
Happy Contributing... :D
